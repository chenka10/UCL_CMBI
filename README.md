This repository contain my work for Computational Models in Biomedical Imaging project.

In this project I experimented with different models to fit Diffusion Weighted MRI data. I implemented, and evaluated these models based on the methods such as AIC, BIC and by researching additional literature in the field.

These models were then used to retrieve information about the scanned tissue, such as diffusion directionality, anisotropy map and uncertainty measurments:
